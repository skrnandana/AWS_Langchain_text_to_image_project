    " There are two main types of methods for summarizing text: abstractive and extractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization generates a new shorter summary in its own words based on understanding the meaning and concepts of the original text. It analyzes the text using advanced natural language techniques to grasp the key ideas and then expresses those ideas in a summarized form using different words and phrases. This is similar to how humans summarize by reading something and then explaining the main points in their own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization works by selecting the most important sentences, phrases or words from the original text to construct a summary. It calculates the weight or importance of each part of the text using algorithms and then chooses the parts with the highest weights to put into the summary. This pulls summarizes by extracting key elements from the text itself rather than interpreting the meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short, abstractive summarization rewrites the key ideas in new words while extractive summarization selects the most salient parts of the existing text. Both aim to distill the essence and most significant information from the original document into a condensed summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to run through 3 methods for summarization that start with basic prompting to summarizing large documents using `map_reduce` method. These aren't the only options, feel free to modify it based on your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3 Levels Of Summarization:**\n",
    "1. **Summarize a couple sentences** - Basic Prompt\n",
    "2. **Summarize a couple paragraphs** - Prompt Templates\n",
    "3. **Summarize a large document with multiple pages** - Map Reduce\n",
    "4. **Summarize a book**\n",

    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how to use **AI21 Summary API** for text summarization using a library of documents as a reference.\n",
